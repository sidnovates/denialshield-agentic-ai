## 🌟 Overview

**Hackios** is a cutting-edge Health Insurance Appeal Assistant powered by **Agentic AI**. It doesn't just generate text; it orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents to analyze, strategize, and fight incorrect claim denials.

By combining **PaddleOCR** for document understanding and **LangGraph** for multi-agent collaboration, Hackios turns a complex, stressful process into a single click.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration
A team of 5 specialized agents works on every appeal:
1.  **Policy Agent**: Analyzes insurance policy documents for coverage rules.
2.  **Medical Agent**: Validates clinical necessity using ICD/CPT codes and guidelines.
3.  **Legal Agent**: Cites relevant state/federal laws (ERISA, ACA).
4.  **Negotiator Agent**: Synthesizes all arguments into a persuasive narrative.
5.  **Auditor Agent**: Critiques the draft and forces revisions if it's not perfect.

### 📄 Formal Appeal Generation
- **Professional Formatting**: Generates strictly formatted PDF appeal letters.
- **Dynamic Fields**: Automatically populates patient details, claim numbers, and dates.
- **Official Layout**: Includes sender/recipient blocks, subject lines, and signatures suitable for certified mail.

### 🔍 Intelligent Analysis
- **Pre-Claim Prevention**: Scores the "Denial Risk" (0-100%) before you submit.
- **Plain English Explanations**: Translates cryptic denial codes (e.g., CO-50) into understandable terms.

### 📱 Modern User Experience
- **Glassmorphic UI**: Beautiful, medical-grade dashboard interface.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Watch the agents work in real-time.
- **Secure Handling**: Local processing for OCR and database storage.
